# networking 

servers, clients and protocols

Any networked computer can be a client 


TCP - payloads sent return acknowledgements 

UDP - unreliable transport: packets are sent but there is no confirmation that the packet was received at the other end

# port and permissions 
nc -lp 1024


# server role 
 Whenever a computer is 'listening' to serve a connection 

# client role
 computers that connect to servers, initiate connection 

# [peer to peer] 
 Aside from servers and clients, there is a third role in computer networks: peer. In a peer to peer network, clients establish connections directly to other clients. Nodes in the network are symmetric with no fixed central serveers.

Examples of peer to peer protocols:
	* bittorrent
	* webrtc
